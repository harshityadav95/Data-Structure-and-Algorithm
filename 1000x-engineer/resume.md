# Resume

1\. **Experience —** Here you can include your internships and current company you are working for. Make sure you include your roles and responsibilities in the team. The company is more interested to see **What have you done** instead of **What Your Organization/Team Does**. Use action verbs like improved , optimized , managed etc. ( Read more [here](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/top-words-to-include-and-avoid-in-your-resume-2063329)). Try to emphasize on what impact you had on your team. The interviewer will focus more on your roles and responsibilities. Also make sure you know the project architecture really well.

2\. **Projects** — Include at least 2 good projects that you can talk about confidently in an interview. Make sure you know those projects in and out. It’s better to avoid saying to the interviewer that I didn’t do this part and hence I am not aware of.

**Achievements :-** Include achievements related to your field as the company is not bothered to see whether you stood first in a relay race or won a music competition. Also quantify your achievements. Like instead of saying “stood 1st in XYZ competition” , state, “Rank 1 out of 3000 participants in XYZ competition”. It makes a greater impact and helps the recruiter to understand your potential.![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1\*mvuG2PZSsaUz\_IgQfxHkHw.png?q=20)![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1\*mvuG2PZSsaUz\_IgQfxHkHw.png)

**Coding Profiles & Social Links** :- Make sure to link your competitive coding profiles and mention your Max Rating in those platforms. Also link your Github and Linkedin profile.![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1\*U1\_Et2egfC9IFJe8IM6zhg.png?q=20)![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/378/1\*U1\_Et2egfC9IFJe8IM6zhg.png)

**Education :** Mention your college from where you got your degree. I feel there is no need to mention your CGPA if it is on the lower side and you have at least an year of experience. Try to highlight the strong points and omit the weak links.

**Skills** : Include the languages and tech stacks you have worked upon and are familiar with. Also attribute how comfortable you are with those languages and frameworks. (Like Wrote Over 5000 lines of codes in JAVA , or give a rating meter.) Don’t include subjects like DBMS , OOPS etc. over here as that would go in your **Coursework** section.![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1\*10UGJJ5OJPQBFy7ojpELxQ.png?q=20)![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/370/1\*10UGJJ5OJPQBFy7ojpELxQ.png)

**Extra-Curricular** — This is an optional section and include only if you have place left to fill. Also include activities that are more related.
