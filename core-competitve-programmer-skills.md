# Core Competitve Programmer Skills

### Why Competitive Programming  

*  Write reliable and efficient code 
* learn and practice algorithm  
* manage time its very limited  
* Crack big interviews 
* Join community of Highly motivated and Smart people

#### Timing and speed matters a lot in programming

### Choosing programming Language :

* C++ , Python , Java
* C\# 

### How Lines of code is really needed to solve a problem  

*  usually the solution is very small few lines of codes  
* bigger problem migh require upto 200 lines of codes 

### Writing the Code  

* Pick  a language
* read the  specific format from terminal or input file to read the data
* ouptut should match the format needed 
* prepare multiple test case to test your code as you right 

### Types of Errors

* Compile time error
* Runtime error 
* Time Limit Exceeded
* Memory Limit Exceeded
* Presentation Error
* Wrong Answer

### Understanding the problem statement 

* Problem statement  
* Input Format \(range of input , string size\)
* Output 
* Sample Input

### Steps in solving a problem  

* Read the statment
* Formalize it
* Invent a solution
* Prove it - taking wrong assumptions in writing the solution
* Implement it
* test the implementation
* Debug if not working
* Submit the Solution

### Soft Skills  

* Ask Community for Help
* Problem posted should be easily to recreate
* Have the project file for the code already created 
* Prepare the template code that can run your logic and not start from scratch
* make backup of codes  using folder or versioning

### Start with the Participation online

* Participate in time  based competition
* solving problems from the archives
* Learn additional algorithm when needed
* Participate in Online competition  Single round matches

### Testing

* Sample test cases 
* Minimal test cases \(1,0 ,-1\)
* Maximal test case \(Numbers in large range 10^9, Integer overflow\)
