The recruiter reached out to me on LinkedIn.

In almost every round, there were questions to test amazon leadership principles. [This article](https://medium.com/@scarletinked/are-you-the-leader-were-looking-for-interviewing-at-amazon-8301d787815d) will give you a good idea about their leadership principles.

1. Round 1 : Code 2 algo questions on an online platform.
2. Round 2 : This was an Algo round. There were two questions asked, and I had to code both of them. There were few questions from Amazon leadership principles.
3. Round 3 : HLD round + Amazon Leadership Principles
4. Round 4 : HLD round + Hiring Manager
5. Round 5 : This was a Bar Raiser round. There was a discussion about past projects and some managerial questions.
