**Atlassian @SD2**

I reached out to their recruiter through LinkedIn.

1. Round 1 : This interview was conducted in karat.io. It is a third-party service that conducts interviews and then shares the result with the company. It was a one hour interview with four algo questions. All questions were extensions of the previous question asked. In the last 10 minutes, there were theoretical questions based on OOP, OS, Garbage collection, etc.
2. Round 2 : This was an LLD round. You need to write a working code with proper low level design and working test cases.
3. Round 3 : Same as Round 2
4. Round 4 : HLD round
5. Round 5 : Culture Fit round
6. Round 6 : Hiring Manager round
