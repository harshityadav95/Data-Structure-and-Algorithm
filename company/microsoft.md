## Microsoft @SD2 <a href="#9414" id="9414"></a>

I applied for Microsoft through referral. I had a total of 4 rounds. All the coding was done in a collaborative online editor.

1. Round 1 : It was an Algo round. There were three algo questions asked during this period. I had to code only the first question, which was checked across multiple test cases.
2. Round 2 : There was one LLD question, coding for which was not required. Apart from this, there were two questions that can’t be categorized into either LLD or HLD, though those problems were quite interesting.
3. Round 3 : There were 2 LLD questions. I had to code only the first one. I didn’t have to write test cases explicitly, and only a dry run was required.
4. Round 4 : HLD round + Hiring Manager
