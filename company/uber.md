# Uber



### **Uber @SD2**

I applied through their careers website.

1. Round 1 : It was an LLD round. The question was pretty vague, and you need to define the scope of the problem and write a working code for it. Unit test cases were also required.
2. Round 2 : There was one algo question, and I had to implement a running code for it.
3. Round 3 : HLD round
4. Round 4 : Hiring Manager Round \(I had two hiring manager round since the position for the first team got filled up in between the process\)
5. Round 5 : This was a Bar Raiser Round. There was a discussion about past projects and some managerial questions.
