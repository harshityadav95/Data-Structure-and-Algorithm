The recruiter reached out to me.

There were three algo rounds. If there is positive feedback in these three rounds, the next set of rounds are scheduled.

I had two algo rounds post this, and one Googliness round \(There was supposed to be just one algo round, but there was some miscommunication, and one of the interviewers took algo round instead of Googliness round\)

I was given a choice after the first set of interviews to either take a system design round or take an algo round.

If there is a positive response from the last two rounds, team fit/matching happens. \(Packet can be passed to Hiring Committee either before the team fit or after the team fit\)
